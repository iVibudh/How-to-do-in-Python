    "# In the previous section we learnt about maps which allow us to transform dataFrame or Series one value at a time. \n",

    "# Essentially, here we are grouping the data based on the couloumn 'points'\n",

    "# The next set application is interesting and very powerful as we are going to use the apply function in groups. \n",

    "# Here lambda df represents the dataframe of each group. \n",
